# Zyon-Transports

Welcome. This is a JPA app for managing a fictional transport brand named Zyon-Transports, and was made during the 4th Epicode buildweek group project.

1. Trasporti.sql is the sql script for generating the tables of postgres DB.
2. In the MainProject class we have explained the main features of the app and have commented some lines of code that you can test.

Your feedback is greatly appreciated,
have a good day,

A.I.
